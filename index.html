              software for multiple generations of Garmin Integrated Flight Decks, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations. 
              I conducted thorough testing by creating an automated regression testing suite in Python. With bugs being identified I worked to resolve
              them through software and requirement changes. Additionally, I implemented customer-requested features to enhance the functionality of 
              the flight decks and leveraged the software architecture to enable runtime-determined features. Throughout the development process, 
              I utilized Git to manage and track changes, ensuring a streamlined workflow.</p>

              <h4>Spotify Weekly Playlist Saver</h4>
              <p>The aim of this project was to create a practical tool for my daily use. Spotify curates weekly playlists for users, 
                but these playlists are not saved from week to week. I wanted to preserve these songs since I often missed the chance to 
                listen to them before they disappeared. To solve this, I wrote a Python script that utilizes Spotify&apos;s API to save 
                the 30 curated songs to a permanent playlist each week. Additionally, I implemented GitHub Actions to automate the script&apos;s 
                execution on a weekly basis. I found this project particularly rewarding as it provided a useful solution that I could integrate into 
                my everyday life.

              <p>
                The aim of this project was to design system-level requirements for a mock environmental information system. 
                Although it was a class project, I am proud that my System Combined Requirements and Design Document (SCRD) won first place 
                in the class competition. This experience significantly improved my ability to write clear and effective requirements, a skill 
                that has proven invaluable during my internship experiences. Overall, this project taught me that software engineering extends 
                beyond writing code; strong foundational requirements are crucial to the success of the entire system.

              <p>
                The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline to analyze 
                and infer insights from data. The ETL pipeline I designed utilized data from both CSV files and an API to gather relevant 
                information. After thoroughly cleaning the data, I analyzed the impact of daily new COVID-19 cases on morning domestic 
                airline flights. For a detailed report on the data, the project&apos;s objectives, and findings, please view the GitHub

              <p>
                Creating this ePortfolio and Resume marked my initial foray into web development. These projects sparked my 
                fascination with web development and significantly supported my role as a student software developer 
                at the University of Arizona. Through self-teaching HTML, CSS, and web development best practices, 
                these projects ignited new passions for me. Working on them provided invaluable insights into the mechanics 
                of web development. I found particular joy in the immediacy of writing a few lines of code and seeing them 
                come to life instantly in my browser! These experiences underscored for me the 
                power of web technologies and reinforced my enthusiasm for pursuing further projects in this field.
